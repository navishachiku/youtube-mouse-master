# Changelog

All notable changes to the **YouTube Mouse Master** project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Shorts Navigation**: Implemented scroll-based navigation for YouTube Shorts. Scrolling outside of configured zones now simulates `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` keys to switch between videos.
- **Dynamic Shorts Monitoring**: Added an intelligent monitoring system (`zoneMonitorInterval`) to track the active Shorts player position, ensuring OSD and debug zones stay aligned during scrolling and video switching.

### Fixed
- **Shorts OSD Positioning**: Fixed an issue where the On-Screen Display (OSD) and Debug Zones were misaligned on Shorts. They now dynamically anchor to the active `ytd-reel-video-renderer` element.
- **Visual Drift**: Resolved a bug where debug zones would detach or drift from the video element when switching Shorts.
- **Z-Index Layering**: Updated OSD construction to attach directly to `document.body` with maximum z-index (`2147483647`) in Shorts mode to prevent being obscured by native overlays.

### Changed
- Refactored `updateZoneVisuals` and `showOSD` to use a shared `findActiveShortsRenderer` helper for consistent player detection.
- Added a 250ms debounce to the Shorts navigation scroll to prevent accidental multi-video skipping.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Shorts Support**: Extended core functionality to support the YouTube Shorts player (`ytd-shorts`).
- **Zone Control for Shorts**: Enabled the 3-zone control system (Volume, Speed, Seek) within the Shorts interface.

### Fixed
- **Event Penetration**: Improved event handling to ensure mouse wheel events inside zones do not trigger default page scrolling on Shorts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Overlay Detection**: Refined the `getTargetZone` logic to correctly distinguish between the main player, mini-player, and other UI layers.
- **Native UI Conflicts**: Added checks to prevent the script from overriding interactions on native YouTube elements (e.g., settings menu, share buttons, ad overlays).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Core Functionality**: Initial release of YouTube Mouse Master.
- **Three-Zone Control**: implemented the default left (Volume), middle (Seek), and right (Speed) interaction zones.
- **Visual OSD**: Added immediate On-Screen Display feedback for all actions (Volume %, Speed x, Time).
- **Customizability**: Exposed detailed configuration object (`CONFIG`) for customizing zone sizes, colors, and actions.
- **Wheel Filtering**: Implemented "Smooth Scroll" compatibility mode and wheel count thresholds (`USE_WHEEL_COUNT_FIXED`).
