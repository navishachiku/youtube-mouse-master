A mouse enhancement tool for online video players: the player is divided into three zones, and a **wheel** scroll inside a zone adjusts volume, playback speed, seeking, and more — buttery smooth. No shortcuts to memorize, no hunting for buttons; one easy scroll gets you there. A settings panel lets you customize every wheel and click action.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Site Support**: Works on **YouTube**, **Bilibili** (`www.bilibili.com`), and **Bahamut Ani.Gamer** (`ani.gamer.com.tw`), with identical zones and actions on every site.

* **Quick Controls**: Set custom action zones on the player that correspond to mouse actions such as clicks and wheel scrolls to quickly adjust volume, speed, progress, etc.

* **Custom Action Zones**: Supports highly customizable sensor zone settings, allowing you to freely adjust zone size and position (default provides Left, Middle, and Right zone configurations).

* **Zero-Overlay Interaction**: Abandons traditional transparent layer overlays and uses high-performance coordinate calculations, ensuring no interference with native UI clicks like progress bars and buttons.

* **Adaptive Wheel**: One physical notch or swipe equals exactly one action on any device — mouse wheels, trackpads, and smooth-scrolling software (Mos, SmoothScroll, Logitech Options+) — with no tuning required. Inertia tails are suppressed and deliberate long swipes stay proportional.

* **Graphical Settings Panel**: Every parameter and zone-action mapping can be adjusted in an in-page panel — changes apply instantly and are stored in the browser, so script updates never wipe your customizations.

## 🎛️ Settings Panel

No code editing required — click the mouse icon on the player control bar to open the settings panel:

* **Four tabs**: General (adaptive wheel, hotkeys, appearance, OSD), Zone Actions, Wheel (adaptive tuning and manual filtering), and Advanced (debug, settings data).
* **Zone action mapping**: Pick a colored zone and assign any action with its value to each trigger (left / right / middle click, wheel up / down):

* **Instant apply & persistence**: Changes take effect immediately; "Save" writes them to browser storage — **script updates never wipe your settings**; "Cancel" or Esc reverts.
* **Hotkeys**: Zone overlay defaults to `Alt+Shift+Z`; the panel hotkey is unbound by default. Both are reassignable in the panel with modifier-combo support (Esc cancels capture, Backspace clears).
* **Export / Import / Reset**: Back up settings as a JSON file, move them to another browser, or restore factory defaults in one click.
* **Interface language**: Follows your browser locale, falling back to English; a manual override is available in the panel.
* **Appearance**: Light / dark / auto (follows system preference).

## ⚙️ Customizable Parameters

Every parameter can be adjusted in the settings panel (recommended). You can also edit the `SETTINGS` and `CONFIG` blocks at the top of the script directly, but note that direct script edits are overwritten on script updates, while panel settings are preserved.
